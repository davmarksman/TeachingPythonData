## Lesson 3: Revision of what we've learned

HW https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud1110 Lesson 4

HW Fizz Buzz -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz.
Count from 1 to 100. Outputting for the number "This is X out of 100", Any number divisible by three is replaced by the word fizz and any number divisible by five by the word buzz. Numbers divisible by 3 and 5 become fizz buzz.

Sample output:
> This is 1 out of 100  
> This is 2 out of 100  
> Fizz  
> This is 4 out of 100

> Buzz

> Fizz

> This is 7 out of 100
